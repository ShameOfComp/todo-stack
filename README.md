TODO Stack
==========

Instead of a TODO list, this is a TODO stack. It is intended for multi-tasking during the work day, and keeping track of the stack of things that you're working on as more and more interruptions keep happening.

It is built using backbone.js and runs completely client-side.

### Keyboard shortcuts

*   __a__ - add new task
*   __j__ - select next task
*   __k__ - select previous task
*   __e__ - edit selected task
*   __#__ - mark task ask completed
